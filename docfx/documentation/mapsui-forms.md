# Mapsui.Forms

Mapsui can be used on Xamarin.Forms with the [Mapsui.Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mapsui.Forms/) nuget package.

Mapsui.Forms is a 'native' Xamarin.Forms implementation, meaning it does
not use Xamarin.Forms Renderers around platform specific components but implements 
a Xamarin.Forms implementation instead.

Mapsui.Forms uses SkiaSharp.Views.Forms to display the map on the
device. This works for iOS, Android, UWP and Mac OS. On WPF there still 
is an issue with placing controls over the Map.
